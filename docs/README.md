HPC systems are increasingly used for data science, machine learning, and
AI.  These systems offer more computational power and memory than a typical
laptop or workstation.  However, there are some pitfalls to avoid when
runnning such workloads, especially regarding I/O.

This session will cover a number of these pitfalls and how to avoid them.
It will also cover some best practices.

## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * have a better understanding of I/O challenges on HPC systems;
  * be able to avoid common pitfalls on HPC systems;
  * be able to make an informed choice on data formats;
  * understand the challenges of running applications that load
    many packages/modules;
  * know some best practices for running Python and R applciations
    on HPC systems.
